Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. It is
similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a
value [(1)]. It can accept some **parameters**, and may define some **local**
**variables** necessary for performing the desired *operation*. These
*parameters* and *local variables* are contained in the **scope of the**
**function**, and *cannot* be accessed from the *outside*. However, a function can
access variables *external to itself* (as long as they are not *overridden*),
such as *global variables* or *variables* in the scope this function is
*encapsulated in*. A **nested function** can access *free variables* that
are defined in *outer scopes*, even when it is being *invoked* **away** from
where it is *defined*. It does this by **capturing** the *free variables* (by
*reference*) into a **closure** [(1)]. *Closure*, *arrow functions*, and more,
are *functional language features* based on [lambda calculus].

This package includes a number of methods to *transform functions*. This enables
you to obtain a desired function by transforming the behavior of existing
functions (*without actually executing them*). The **result** of a function can
be manipulated with [negate]. In case a *pure* function is expensive, its
results can **cached** with [memoize]. **Parameters** of a function can be
manipulated with [reverse], [spread], [unspread]. [reverse] flips the order of
parameters, [spread] spreads the first array parameter of a function, and
[unspread] combines all parameters into the first parameter (array). If you want
some **functional** **behavior**, [compose], [composeRight], [curry], and
[curryRight] can be used. [composeRight] is also known as [pipe-forward
operator] or [function chaining]. If you are unfamiliar, [Haskell] is a great
purely functional language, and there is great [haskell beginner guide] to learn
from.

To control invocation **time** of a function, use [delay]. A function can be
**rate controlled** with [restrict], [debounce], [debounceEarly], [throttle],
[throttleEarly]. [debounce] and [debounceEarly] prevent the invocation of a
function during **hot** periods (when there are too many calls), and can be used
for example to issue AJAX request after user input has stopped (for certain
delay time). [throttle] and [throttleEarly] can be used to limit the rate of
invocation of a function, and can be used for example to minimize system usage
when a user is [constantly refreshing a webpage]. Except [restrict], all
*rate/time control* methods can be *flushed* (`flush()`) to invoke the target
function immediately, or *cleared* (`clear()`) to disable invocation of the
target function.

In addition, [is], [isAsync], [isGenerator], [name], and [length] obtain
metadata (about) information on a function. To attach a `this` to a function,
use [bind]. A few generic functions are also included: [NOOP], [FALSE], [TRUE],
[IDENTITY], [COMPARE], [ARGUMENTS].
